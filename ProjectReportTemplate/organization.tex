In this section we describe the overall goal of the project, the internal organisation and work distribution of our group, and our activities during the Blast-off of the project.  \\

\subsection{Goal of the Software}

In this subsection we describe the goal of the Test Data Analyser (TDA). The TDA is developed for medatixx GmbH \& Co. KG, a company that develops software for medical practices. TDA is an application to help software developers and testers at medatixx to analyse test data of their software. Purpose, advantage, and measurement are the three parts of which the goal of TDA is made of. \\
\ \\
\large\textbf{Purpose}\\ 
During the development of their software, medatixx uses a sequence of builds, i.e. (pre-)release versions of the software. To ensure the quality of their product, each build is tested via a number of unit tests which are defined and executed on the classes of the corresponding build. The collection of these unit tests, their classes and the build they belong to, and their results is called a test run. TDA shall support the analysis of these test runs to help medatixx to discover builds with classes that are problematic to test. \\ 
To do so, TDA shall extract the necessary information from the test run XML files provided by medatixx, analyse the information in different ways including the usesage of the Apriori algorithm and visualise the results of the information analysis. \\ 
\ \\

\large\textbf{Advantage}\\ 
The TDA provides new and more detailled information on the tests of different builds. It highlights the classes with the highest failure percentage of a specific test run. It shows the evolution of a class by visualising its failure percentages over multiple test runs. By using the Apriori algorithm it shows possible associations between different classes. It offers an easy method to compare the tests of a specific class in different test runs. \\ 
With the additional information the TDA is making available for testers at medatixx, they get new insight into their testing methodology and the overall test quality is improved. \\
\ \\

\large\textbf{Measurement}\\ 
Due to the easily accessible information on test runs and the discovered associations between classes, the resolution of failed classes and their corresponding unit tests will be accelerated by 50 \%.

\subsection{Project Blast-off}

The Project Blast-off is the most important activity to decide whether or not to go ahead with a project. It is used to gather information on the project and make sure that it is viable and well founded. \\ 
Before we defined our goal for the project, we agreed that every member of our group should read and understand the project brief until our first official meeting. In our first meeting we collectively went through the requirements and every single described scenario. After making sure we were all on the same page and understood the content, we defined our goal of the whole project as described in subsection 1.1. \\ 
We continued by going through it again and highlighting epics and first user stories. In further cycles we worked on detailing them and lastly started on finding adequate tasks for the now written cards. Those tasks were not yet assigned to individual persons, as we still wanted to have the option to allocate them according to one’s time and knowledge on the described topic later on. Soon first challenges arose when it came down to connecting tasks with one adequate user story. It appears that some tasks are used for many user stories, because they describe core functionalities and therefore have to be implemented in order to make the rest working. Then again, sometimes it was just difficult to assign a specific task to a user story at all, because it described a mandatory functionality that just wasn’t covered by any adequate user story and creating one seemed not to be possible. We decided to discuss our concerns in the first meeting with the client.\\ 
During further discussion we identified the stakeholders of the project as shown in the stakeholder map in figure \ref{StakeMap}. \\

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{pics/StakeMap2.jpg}
\caption{Stakeholder map}
\label{StakeMap}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

As you can see in figure \ref{StakeMap} medatixx GmbH \& Co. KG is listed as customer and client, since they use the TDA as an inhouse application. The typical users or normal operators of TDA are software testers and developers at medatixx. \\ 
In the next step we thought about the boundaries of our system, i.e. the scope of the work. As shown in figure \ref{Scope}, the TDA only has one indirect interface to adjacent systems. That interface is used by medatixx to provide the XML files from which TDA extracts the necessary information. We visualised this connection in the following context diagram. \\

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{pics/Scope_of_Work_Context_Diagram_v2.jpg}
\caption{Context diagram} 
\label{Scope}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

After we defined the scope of work of the TDA we discussed which architecture and design patterns we could use for our system. Also first ideas for specific classes and interfaces arose. Gladly, all of us had already visited the DSG-AJP-B course in previous semesters and so we could all contribute equally to the discussion without too much additional explanation of any named techniques. Since we have to deliver a GUI application in Java, we decided on a standard model-view-controller pattern. The corresponding high level architecture diagram is shown below in figure \ref{HLA}. \\

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{pics/Architecture_diagram.jpg}
\caption{High level architecture} 
\label{HLA}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In the next step we constructed a central glossary to minimize misunderstandings in our communication and make sure to understand the language of the client. \\ 

\begin{table}[h]
  \caption{Glossary}
  \label{Glossary}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{p{2.3cm}||p{10cm}|}
  	Term & Meaning \\ 
  	\hline
  	\hline
  	Test run & A collection of unit tests of one specific build \\ 
  	\hline
  	Failure percentage & Failure percentage of class C = (Number of failed unit tests for class C) / (Total number of unit tests for class C) \\ 
  	\hline
  	TDA & Test Data Analyser (the program to be developed) \\ 
  	\hline
  	Problematic class & Class with a high test failure percentage \\ 
  	\hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The last task of sprint 0 was to conduct a risk analysis. Most likely we have to deal with sickness of individual persons every now and then. We try to limit the impact of this by good group communication, shared responsibilities and documentation. Also it is likely that the client changes the specifications along the way, what we’re going to cope by building adaptable software with loose coupling and high cohesion. The risks with the highest impact would be someone leaving the project or the complete loss of all our data. We are going to deal with this with shared responsibilities and backups, respectively. A complete and detailed risk analysis is shown in table \ref{Risks}. \\ 

\begin{table}[h]
