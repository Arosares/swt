\subsection{Development Process}
\emph{How well did your group's development process work, and why? Did the 
process change between sprints?  In addition, compare and contrast the SCRUM 
process as practised by your group to (i)~`the' textbook SCRUM 
process~\cite{scrumbook} and (ii)~the other software development processes 
presented in module SWT-FSE-B.  Could your group's development process 
be improved, and by which means?}

\subsection{Team Work}
\emph{How well did your team work together?  Was the distribution of work and the communication among team members effective? Was the communication with the client effective?}

\subsection{Lessons Learned}
\emph{What would you change if you could re-start the project, regarding the employed techniques, the conduct of the project and any other matters that you consider relevant?  What should stay the same?}
