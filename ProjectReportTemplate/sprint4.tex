\subsection{Sprint No.~4}

\emph{(Approx.~2--3~pages of text.)}

\subsubsection*{Sprint Planning}

Goal: Rework apriori algorithm and display its results and implement evolution of classes' unittest comparison (additional usage scenario)

The goal for Sprint 4 was to rework the Apriori Algorithm for higher performance, and actually display it's results in our GUI, as well as the implementation of our first bonus usage scenario, which we suggested in Sprint 1. 
For this purpose, we created a new User Story for Apriori in line with our effort to improve internal documentation.
We also started splitting User Stories into more tasks than before and introduced a general category for tasks that could be done if time allowed, mostly related to polishing or minor bug fixes.

\begin{itemize}
	\item User Story 23: Implement Apriori Algorithm
	\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[h]

\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
	\item User Story 24: Display Analysis Data

\begin{itemize}
	\item User Story 213: Evolution of a class (additional usage scenario)
	\end{itemize}

  \begin{tabular}{p{1cm}|p{5cm}|p{3cm}|}

  	213.1 & Mockup of additional usage scenario "evolution of a class" & Simon Meyer \\ 
  	\hline
  	213.2* & Change all doubleclicks to singleclicks & Frank Kessler \\

  	\hline
  	213.8 & fill comparison/"evolution of a class" view with data & Frank Kessler \\ 
  	\hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
	\item General Tasks (No User Story)
	\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[h]
  \caption{General Tasks}
  \label{General Tasks}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{p{1cm}|p{5cm}|p{3cm}|}
  	Nr & Description & Assigned \\ 
  	\hline
  	(General) & clear data: clear testrunsummary as well & --- \\ 
  	\hline
  	(General) & change tableview highlighting (background, textcolour) & --- \\ 
  	\hline
  	(General) & hide classes with 0 failure percentage & --- \\ 
  	\hline
  	(General) & Update UseCase- and Scope-of-Workarea Diagrams & Andreas Köllner \\ 
  	\hline
  	(General) & digitalize paper-mockups & Andreas Köllner \\ 
  	\hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
We used the "General" category to sum up tasks that a teammember could do when their main task was done for the sprint increment or they otherwise had to wait on the work of another team member.
