\subsection{Sprint No.~5}

\emph{(Approx.~2--3~pages of text.)}

\subsubsection*{Sprint Planning}

Goal: Finalize functionality (Comparison View and Distance-Filter in Apriori) + Testing.
Deliver the idea of an additional Usage Scenario.
Make the product ready for Version 1.0 release.

The primary goal of Sprint 5 was to finish, test, and document everything in the project. This included writing tests where coverage wasn't sufficient, and improving code documentation which had lagged behind the occasional refactoring. For this purpose, we created an extra story for documentation and tasks for testing and documenting all sections of code we had.

\begin{itemize}
	\item User Story 1: Testing (Prio 1 / Size M)
	\end{itemize}
As a client,
I want the software to be tested,
such that it runs reliably.

\begin{itemize}

As a client, I want a valuable feature, such that I can further analyze my testruns.

\subsubsection*{Noteworthy Development Aspects}

Our primary aim for this last sprint was to wrap up development as cleanly as possible. 
As such, our focus was on ensuring the project was properly documented and tested, and our tasks and priorities reflected as much. 
As we did not manage to create a second additional usage scenario by sprint 4, and thus would have been unable to present it before implementation anyways, we didn't plan with it's implementation at all and contented ourselves with creating an additional scenario concept for presentation at the end of sprint 5. 
Thus, our only remaining features to be implemented were some leftover tasks from Sprint 4.
