\subsubsection*{Sprint Planning}

Goal: Association Analysis and Graph

The goal for Sprint 3 was to finish and merge in the LineChart visual output that missed the Sprint 2 deadline (by then still called "Graph") and the implementation of the Apriori Algorithm. 
For the purpose of creating a working Apriori Implementation, a research story with unknown size was assigned. 
In the first session, everyone not assigned to the LineChart was busy with refactoring previous code or improving the GUI, as we expected additional work to crop up once the chart was integrated into the GUI and work on Apriori could not start until research was done.

\subsubsection*{Noteworthy Development Aspects}

\subsubsection*{Sprint Review}
The original intent for Sprint 3 was to implement both the LineChart visual output that missed the Sprint 2 deadline and the Apriori Algorithm. For this purpose, development time was allotted to research , and some trial and error was expected on both user stories. 
While the GUI implementation of the Chart proved to be easier than expected, the Apriori development did not. Mid Sprint, the Group received the Change Request, and, after analysing the new requirements, it was evident that the planned Apriori implementation would have to be significantly changed after the Change request would be merged in. 
Thus we decided to prioritize the implementation of the treeview necessary for the adapted Apriori both in the program logic and the GUI.
